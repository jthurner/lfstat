# - think about setting the end date of unterminated droughts to NA


# - support SI prefixes in summary tables and plots
#   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11340444/is-there-an-r-function-to-format-number-using-unit-prefix
#   package sitools
# - summary of deficits should ouput threshold
# - store threshold and threshold-gernerating function in attributes
# - summary should output correct volumes (maybe use extra arg?)
# - document and generalize ev_return_period()
# - make hyear_start a class to track how hyear_start was set (from column, arg, default argument)
# - write as.hyear_start() function, that converts any possible hyear_start() into an integer,
#   assignment funciton should use it

# - improve spelling, documentation

# - find.droughts should issue a warning if no droughts are found.
# - summary.deficit() can only work if there are drought events.
#   write check and unit test
